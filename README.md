Welcome to my Capstone Project for my [Udacity's C++ Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213)!

For this project, I chose to improve the SDL game Snake. I will add/have added the following features to the game:
🐍 The snakes dies when it runs into the edges of the grid, instead of going through
<!-- 🐍 High scores table
🐍 Splash screen with selection of mode (one player, two players, high scores)
🐍 Enemy snake that uses A* search to look for the food -->

<!-- IMAGE OR GIF OR VIDEO OF THE APPLICATION --->
